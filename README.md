节奏只需*点击一下*即可！

This is the future – and final – iteration of the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) game client which marks the beginning of an open era! Currently known by and released under the release codename "*lazer*". As in sharper than cutting-edge.

### Downloading the source code

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu
cd osu
```

To update the source code to the latest commit, run the following command inside the `osu` directory:

```shell
git pull
```

#### From CLI

You can also build and run *osu!* from the command-line with a single command:

```shell
dotnet run --project osu.Desktop
```

When running locally to do any kind of performance testing, make sure to add `-c Release` to the build command, as the overhead of running with the default `Debug` configuration can be large (especially when testing with local framework modifications as below).

If the build fails, try to restore NuGet packages with `dotnet restore`.

### Testing with resource/framework modifications

Sometimes it may be necessary to cross-test changes in [osu-resources](https://github.com/ppy/osu-resources) or [osu-framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). This can be quickly achieved using included commands:

Windows:

```ps
UseLocalFramework.ps1
UseLocalResources.ps1
```

macOS / Linux:

```ps
UseLocalFramework.sh
UseLocalResources.sh
```

Note that these commands assume you have the relevant project(s) checked out in adjacent directories:

```
|- osu            // this repository
|- osu-framework
|- osu-resources
